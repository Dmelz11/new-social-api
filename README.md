# New-Social-Api

## Description

This API is built to meet the needs of a social network app where you can perform CRUD functions on Users and Thoughts. Users are also able to react to other user's thoughts by creating or deleting reactions. Users can also add or remove friends. All of these opperations take place using Insomnia. This API uses Express.js for routing the MongoDB and Mongoose.

## Credits

I once again was fortunate to have been able to get some help from my tutor Jose Lopez, who showed me how to create folders and http requests in Insomnia which helped in creating the data for the users, thoughts and reactions. He also stressed again the activities to see
how the routing and models are working to achieve the requests and responses that the functions are creating.
